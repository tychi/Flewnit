  physicsDataStructures.cl

  
  This source file is both included by the C++ Application and by the OpenCL kernels;
  Hence, some conditional compilation must be done to mask incompatible code segments;
  
  Some poeple may call it a hack, but I'm doing so to ensure synch of data structures by omitting boilerplate duplicate definitions;
  The OpenCL API doesn't provide any type checks, alignment/layout checks etc, so boilerplate code is especially error prone here;
  
  By using this file in both host and device code, even some macros can be used by the app, so that consistency is guaranteed;

  My first approach was the folloing struct; But then i realized that when binding a buffer containing such a structure
  to OpenGL, maybe strange effects like dependency on endianess may occur; Plus, the fact that both ID values get the same
  bit count doesn't reflect that there are much more particles than "abstract" objects like fluids or rigid bodies;
  Additionally, the internal access to non-4byte-aligned values might also work only via bit shiftings, so that there would be
  no performance gain against working with explicit codings intor bit fields;
  To conclude, the two IDs of the "ParticleObjectInfo" are now encoded into a uint, see below;
  
  typedef struct
  { 
  
    ushort objectID; //belongs to fluid if is < RIGID_BODY_OFFSET, else belongs to rigidbody with ID (objectID - RIGID_BODY_OFFSET);
                     //This rather complicated ID handling comes from the fact that we want omit branches (at least in simulation phases
                     //which don't compute densities) and hence we retrieve the particle masses via array indexing instead of 
                     //branching
    ushort particleID;  //gRigidBodyParticleIndexTable [ rigidBodyID * NUM_MAX_PARTICLES_PER_RIGID_BODY + particleID ]
                        //yields the final index of the particle's attributes in the current physical attribute buffers
                        
  } ParticleObjectInfo;
  */
