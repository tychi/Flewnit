Overall SPH Fluid Simulation - Conceptual Notes
================================================

TODO research:
------------------
  - Z-Index formula (Goswami 2010 -> Mor66)
  
  - first hints for parallel radix sort parallel prefix sum + parallel reduction:
    (maybe not that complete, but the whole of all algos will be extractable from all my collected papers+
     printed thesises + gpu gems) : 
      - http://http.developer.nvidia.com/GPUGems3/gpugems3_ch32.html <-- basic paper for parallel scan with CUDA
      - http://http.developer.nvidia.com/GPUGems3/gpugems3_ch39.html <-- application for broad phase coll. detection 
      
  - refresh knowledge about efficient atomicMin/Max/Inc etc. calculation patterns:
    - http://supercomputingblog.com/cuda/cuda-tutorial-5-performance-of-atomics/
    
          
 - refresh work efficient parallel prefix sum, especially the avoidance of bank conflicts:
    ERROR in GPU gems paper:
       1. #define NUM_BANKS 16  
       2. #define LOG_NUM_BANKS 4  
       3. #define CONFLICT_FREE_OFFSET(n) \  
       4.     ((n) >> NUM_BANKS + (n) >> (2 * LOG_NUM_BANKS))  
       
      must be:
       1. #define NUM_BANKS 16  
       2. #define LOG_NUM_BANKS 4  
       3. #define CONFLICT_FREE_OFFSET(n) \  
       4.     ((n) >> NUM_BANKS + (n) >> (LOG_NUM_BANKS))  
       because padding must be every 16 elements for non-fermi GPUs
       
       The division by 2^16 is also bullshit as we never can have more than 1024 threads on non-fermi GPUs 
       (I dont' understand this strange offset anyway, even if n would be possible to be greater than 65k).
       Hence:
       1. #define NUM_BANKS 16  
       2. #define LOG_NUM_BANKS 4  
       3. #define CONFLICT_FREE_OFFSET(n) \  
       4.     ( (n) >> (LOG_NUM_BANKS) )
       
       For Fermi GPUs:
       1. #define NUM_BANKS 32
       2. #define LOG_NUM_BANKS 5
       3. #define CONFLICT_FREE_OFFSET(n) \  
       4.     ( (n) >> (LOG_NUM_BANKS) )

Parallel Prefix Sum concepts:
-----------------------------
  - Parallel Prefix Sum:
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    - scheme: 
      - Kernel1 :
          - parallel scan locally on work group scale, write sum to globalScanArray:
            -(TODO refine)
      - Kernel2: 
          - one single work group scans globalScanArray; (we are finished if only the total sum is of interest)
      - Kernel3: 
          - if total prefix sum is of interest: 
              - launch as many work groups as in kernel 1:
                - every work group grabs one item of globalScanArray and adds this value to every item 
                  in its range within the actual scanResultArray;
      
  - Parallel Reduction:
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    - scheme:
      - do a parallel prefix sum (see above) in order to calculate the new array indices for each element in originalArray;
      - Kernel4: 
        - if(isValid(currentElement)):
           compactedElementArray[ scanResultArray[ currentElementIndex] ] = currentElement;
           
  - Parallel Radix Sort:
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   
    - TODO
  
  
Simulation Algorithm:
---------------------
  Phase I: Update Accleration Structure:
  --------------------------------------
    - Kernel calculateZIndexKernel:
      - calculate z-Index for each particle, write to zIndexBuffer
    - Kernel parallelRadixSortKernel (actually three kernels):
      - sort particles according to z-Index via Parallel Radix Sort 
    - Kernel reorderAttributes
         - (maybe to include here: TODO rigid body meta data calculation)
    
  
    - Kernel updateUniformGridKernel:
      - one work item per particle: 
          if(globalID != 0)
          {
            if(sortedZIndices[globalID] != sortedZIndices[globalID -1])
            {
              //left index is different, i.e. here starts a new index; set the relevant start index:
              uniGridParticleStartIndices[particleZIndex]=globalID;
            }
          }
          //buffers are flushed to zero, so following is obsolete:
          //else{
          //  uniGridParticleStartIndices[particleZIndex]=0;
          //}
          
          if(globalID != (numParticles -1))
          {
            if(sortedZIndices[globalID] != sortedZIndices[globalID +1])
            {
              //right index is different, i.e. here ends the particle list for the voxel containing this particle;
              //set the relevant end index to globalID +1, so that the particle count can be derived by (startIndex-EndIndex)
              //during voxel split and compression;
              uniGridParticleEndIndices[particleZIndex]=globalID +1;
            }
          }
          else{
            uniGridParticleEndIndices[particleZIndex]=globalID +1;
          }
          
          //bullsh** from Goswami paper? Seems quite unnecessary to me and wasting operations and bandwidth:
          "Whereas the first particle in a block can
          be determined using the atomicMin operation in CUDA, the
          number of particles is found by incrementing a particle count
          with atomicInc. Thus each particle updates both the starting
          index and particle count of its block in the list B [...]"
          //atomicMin( uniformGrid[getUniformGridArrayIndex(currentParticle.zIndex)].particleStartIndex, currentParticleArrayIndex);
          //atomicInc( uniformGrid[getUniformGridArrayIndex(currentParticle.zIndex)].numContainingParticles);

     
   
   
    - Kernel splitAndCompressUniformGridKernel:
      //again, [Gotswamis2010] talks about atomicMin
      - one work item per uniform grid cell:
          input: 
            __global int* uniGridParticleStartIndices; //size: uniformGridCellsPerDimension^3;
            __global int* uniGridParticleEndIndices;   //size: uniformGridCellsPerDimension^3;
          output:
            __global int* uniGridScanResult; //size: uniformGridCellsPerDimension^3;
            __global int* resultsOfLocalScans; //size: numWorkItems
          local:
            __local int localUnigridScanResult[numWorkItems];
            
          
          //{ 
          //tabulate with partially sequential stuff for "sounter sharing" in order to minimize the scan array 
          //(and like this to reduce the kernel count from 3 to 2, because the "scan of intermediate scan results" is small enough
          //to be performed by each work group itself) and to provide better work/kernelInvocation ratio
          for i = 0 to counterShareGroupSize :
            calculate index after the strange sharegroup-scheme
            int endIndex = uniGridParticleEndIndices[index];
            if(endIndex != 0)
            {
              //cell not empty:
              localUnigridScanResult[localID] = (uniGridParticleStartIndices[index] - endIndex) / maxParticlesPerCell +1;            
            }
          //}
          
          //{//scan
          //do a local scan on localUnigridScanResult and write results to global memory
              
          //}
    
    - Kernel finishSplitAndCompressUniformGridKernel:
        //{//scan
        //do a "global scan" on resultsOfLocalScans (at least until get_work_group(0))and compute final split/compacting offsets
            
        //}
    
      - kind of parallel reduction via parallel prefix sum + split of overpopulated blocks (atomicInc?)
        (TODO freshen up parallel prefix sum and related applications)
  -----------------------------------
    (todo copy from hand written notes;)
    (note: integration via Velocity Verlet method, as because we need explicit velocities, leap frog is not applicable,
    i.e. two evalutations for both position and velocitiy and force have to be done per simulation step; Regarding this fact,
    Velocity Verlet is slightly more accurate at the same computational cost;
